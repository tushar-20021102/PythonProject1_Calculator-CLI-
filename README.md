# PythonProject1_Calculator-CLI-
This repository showcases the evolution of a simple calculator project in Python, starting from a procedural approach and moving into object-oriented programming with instance methods and static methods. It highlights the differences between normal methods and static methods, making it a useful resource for beginners learning OOP in Python.


Python Project ‚Äì Command-Line Calculator
üìå Project Overview

This repository presents a step-by-step learning journey of building a Command-Line Calculator in Python. It starts with a procedural programming approach, then evolves into an Object-Oriented design with instance methods, and finally transitions into a Static Method implementation.

The progression is designed to help beginners understand how Python code can evolve from simple functions to more structured and reusable object-oriented designs.

üöÄ Learning Journey
1Ô∏è‚É£ Procedural Approach ‚Äì Functions Only

The first version implements a calculator using basic functions (add, subtract, multiply, division). Users interact through the command line, choosing an operation and providing inputs.

Focus: Taking input, writing functions, using conditional logic, and handling division by zero.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Object-Oriented Approach ‚Äì Using Instance Methods

The second version refactors the calculator into a class-based design using instance methods. Here, self binds each method to an object, meaning the calculator must be instantiated before calling methods.

Focus: Understanding classes, objects, methods, and the role of self.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Object-Oriented Approach ‚Äì Using Static Methods

The third version introduces @staticmethod, allowing calculator methods to be called without creating an object. This makes the design cleaner while still logically grouping functions inside a class.

Focus: Difference between instance methods and static methods, and when to use them.
